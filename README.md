# Login-Page-Using-AngularJS
Developed a responsive singlepage web application using AngularJS framework.
There are 2 components,i.e, two webpages. Products and userlogin.
The user is asked to login with his/her verified username and password which i verified. When the login is successful, the user gets transformed to another webpage called products.
This webpage contains a table of products and comparison between each of them.
The user can edit contents of table by pressing the button edit and the changes are printed in the page console
The user can logout and return to the login page again. This is achieved by routing.
